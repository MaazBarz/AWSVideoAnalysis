# AWSVideoAnalysis
An A.I. powered video analysis tool developed using AWS Rekognition to solve a technical security issue.

Security is required in all forms of mediums, whether it be physical or digital. The key to securing something relies on having a detection system to catch all potential threats in order to ensure safety. In the era of technology we live in today, the detection process for video security analysis can be taxing and tedious. We propose a solution that requires less manual labour to go through by being more automated and reducing human efforts. Based on the research and testing using Amazon Web Services, we created an application that aids us in these efforts.
